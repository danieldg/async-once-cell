//! A collection of lazy initialized values that are created by `Future`s.
//!
//! [OnceCell]'s API is similar to the [`once_cell`](https://crates.io/crates/once_cell) crate,
//! [`std::cell::OnceCell`], or [`std::sync::OnceLock`].  It provides an async version of a cell
//! that can only be initialized once, permitting tasks to wait on the initialization if it is
//! already running instead of racing multiple initialization tasks.
//!
//! Unlike threads, tasks can be cancelled at any point where they block.  [OnceCell] deals with
//! this by allowing another initializer to run if the task currently initializing the cell is
//! dropped.  This also allows for fallible initialization using [OnceCell::get_or_try_init] and
//! for the initializing `Future` to contain borrows or use references to thread-local data.
//!
//! [Lazy] takes the opposite approach: it wraps a single `Future` which is cooperatively run to
//! completion by any polling task.  This requires that the initialization function be independent
//! of the calling context, but will never restart an initializing function just because the
//! surrounding task was cancelled.  Using a trait object (`Pin<Box<dyn Future>>`) for the future
//! may simplify using this type in data structures.
//!
//! # Overhead
//!
//! Both cells use two `usize`s to store state and do not retain any allocations after
//! initialization is complete.  Allocations are only required if there is contention.
//!
//! Accessing an already-initialized cell is as cheap as possible: only one atomic load with
//! Acquire ordering.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! ## The `critical-section` feature
//!
//! If this feature is enabled, the [`critical-section`](https://crates.io/crates/critical-section)
//! crate is used instead of an `std` mutex.  You must depend on that crate and select a locking
//! implementation; see [its documentation](https://docs.rs/critical-section/) for details.
//!
//! ## The `std` feature
//!
//! This is currently a no-op, but might in the future be used to expose APIs that depends on
//! types only in `std`.  It does *not* control the locking implementation.

// How it works:
//
// The basic design goal of async_once_cell is to make the simpler, more common cases as fast and
// efficient as possible while reverting to a reasonably performant implementation when that's not
// possible.
//
// The fastest path is "access an already-initialized cell": this takes one atomic load with
// acquire ordering, and doing it with any less is not possible without extreme, platform-specific
// mechanisms (for example, the membarrier system call on Linux) which would make filling the cell
// significantly more expensive.
//
// The fast path for filling a cell is when there is no contention.  The types in this crate will
// not allocate in this scenario, which proceeds according to this summary:
//
//  1. A single task runs get_or_try_init, which calls Inner::initialize(true)
//  2. Inner::state transitions from NEW to QINIT_BIT, and a QuickInitGuard is returned
//  3. The init future is run and completes successfully (possibly after yielding)
//  4. The value is written to the UnsafeCell
//  5. Inner::state transitions from QINIT_BIT to READY_BIT during QuickInitGuard's Drop
//
// If the init future fails (due to returning an error or a panic), then:
//  4. The UnsafeCell remains uninitialized
//  5. Inner::state transitions from QINIT_BIT to NEW during QuickInitGuard's Drop
//
// The fast path does not use Inner::queue at all, and only needs to check it once the cell
// transitions to the ready state (in order to handle the edge case where a queue was created but
// was not actually needed).
//
// Slow path:
//
// If a second task attempts to start initialization, it will not succeed in transitioning
// Inner::state from NEW to QINIT_BIT.  Instead, it will create a Queue on the heap, storing it in
// Inner::queue and creating a QueueRef pointing at it.  This Queue will hold the Wakers for all
// tasks that attempt to perform initialization.  When a QuickInitGuard or QueueHead is dropped,
// all tasks are woken and will either proceed directly to obtaining a reference (if initialization
// was successful) or race to create a new QueueHead, with losers re-queuing in a new Waker list.
//
// Once a Queue has been created for an Inner, it remains valid as long as either a reference
// exists (as determined by the reference count in Inner::state) or the state is not ready.  A
// QueueRef represents one reference to the Queue (similar to how Arc<Queue> would act).
//
// The wake-up behavior used here is optimized for the common case where an initialization function
// succeeds and a mass wake-up results in all woken tasks able to proceed with returning a
// reference to the just-stored value.  If initialization fails, it would in theory be possible to
// only wake one of the pending tasks, since only one task will be able to make useful progress by
// becoming the new QueueHead.  However, to avoid a lost wakeup, this would require tracking wakers
// and removing them when a QueueRef is dropped.  The extra overhead required to maintain the list
// of wakers is not worth the extra complexity and locking in the common case where the QueueRef
// was dropped due to a successful initialization.
